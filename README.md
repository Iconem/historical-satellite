Simple map UX to select through Planet Historical Monthly Basemaps and compare it against other TMS basemaps (like Google, Bing, Here, ESRI, Mapbox, Yandex)

Rough initial commit, with:

- 2 Maps in a Split view (split-screen or side-by-side)
- Settings component to select map timestamp
- Slider with play capabilities (forward/backward, auto or step-by-step)
- Selector to choose TMS (via a TMS URL, or a monthly basemap)
